<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not surprisingly, security and privacy of data is atop the list of priorities for CFOs and finance leaders. This is, according to the researchers, understandable, because they see what is going on in the market and read about security issues and challenges in the media. Unlike other financial-related risks and controls, finance leaders rely on others – IT and security teams – to articulate and implement specific controls and protections for data governance and cyber risk.</p>

They also turn to SaaS for ‘point solutions’ on the fringes of their operations, including security analytics and KYC verification. But as application offerings improve and as COOs and CIOs get comfortable with the arrangements, the technology is rapidly becoming the way that core activity is processed.</p>

<p>In 2020, we will see more banks coming to realise the value strategic partnerships can bring, enabling them to become the preferred payment platform of choice. This can have a truly transformational effect, by opening up access to data from a much wider pool of people than ever before. If a bank is able to partner with a property platform and become its first port of call for customers, it could be in line to jump to the front of the queue for large transactions, such as mortgage applications and leasing.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Security is paramount for financial institutions, from mobile apps and web portals to third-party networks. Blockchain is a distributed database that can keep track of every transaction with multiple points of verification. The multipoint verification secures the information being transmitted and safely stores details of every step across multiple nodes (computers/servers) of a network. Blockchain is used by banks and financial institutions to facilitate faster, safer and more transparent transactions or currency exchanges for customers, significantly reducing balance sheet risks.</p>

<p>The best way that you can enhance your customers’ experience nowadays is by putting out video content, and the Finance industry is not exempted from this. Your customers may not all be fluent in all the ‘how’s’ of your product or services and they may also not have enough time to read through all your websites to find out enough information. So, the best solution here is to use video marketing to capture their attention and provide faster solutions. It shows that you can get an 80% boost in your conversions by integrating videos into your landing page.</p>

It is to help shift from a product mindset to a customer-centric one by providing them with a ‘voice’ that answers their queries.</p>

<p>Now, the thing is, people want to be able to even do their banking at just one click of a button from wherever they are, at whatever time of the day. Thankfully, many banks have developed their own user-friendly apps and optimized their websites so that their customers can actively engage without having to physically go to the bank. They can message their queries through the app, schedule appointments, check their deposit balance, etc. What we can learn from them is that if financial companies want to stay relevant and not fall behind, it’s important for them to keep integrating multiple platforms and facilitate smooth communication and cross-platform support for their customers.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Talent strategies must meet emerging requirements for digital competencies. Finance transformation means that finance will face skill and competency gaps in areas ranging from data interpretation and data manipulation to IT fulfillment and vendor management. “Finance leaders must look at how they recruit and develop staff, as well as how they retain them and provide career growth for them,” says Wilton. “A lack of digital competencies in finance will quickly affect an organization’s ability to make good decisions.”</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As opposed to a one-size-fits-all centralized data governance model, allow governance to be distributed to data owners where appropriate. This helps the finance function optimize data for decision-readiness as opposed to accuracy and precision. In practice this means adapting financial governance principles for non-financial performance data, creating trust in internal reports by incorporating more intuitive data alongside highly-governed data, and defining the relationship between financial and operational data.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As finance seeks to reduce costs while improving analytical insight, many organizations are relocating finance analytics in scalable centralized models, governed by a finance center of excellence (COE). Hub-and-spoke models, for example, place the finance COE at the center, where data scientists handle data mining and collection, as well as synthesis and modelling. Those ‘spokes’ handle tasks such as project scoping, building analysis problems, translating analysis into business terms and delivering presentations based on the analytics.</p>

But while companies face difficult choices, especially in uncertain conditions, winners are acting to optimize costs now. CFOs need to know how their costs compare to peers, identify how to adapt their cost structure to outperform peers and drive change across the organization to pursue targeted growth bets while eliminating value-destroying projects.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many financial institutions are still not ready for digitization. They’re built on top of old and outdated systems in need of a back office overhaul to even begin trying to implement new fintech products. While some of the bigger banks have invested heavily in digital transformation, a vast majority of the industry has not transformed their back offices yet. Recent reports confirm that financial service providers are way behind the rest of the world: 55% of banks report a lack in digitally maturity.</p>

Remote Work</a></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Along with companies in almost every other sector, financial institutions have had to deal with the new reality of working remotely. Many have already speculated on the macro trends of moving remote (decrease in commercial real estate prices, fewer car sales, etc.), but financial institutions are in a unique situation. Consumers are still used to going to branches for their banking, and even for those who wish to interact solely via digital channels, many banks don’t even have online applications/solutions for completing loans, opening accounts, etc.</p>

Off-branch Customer Experience</a></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now that branches, offices, and on-site meetings are limited, financial institutions need to reinvent the way they communicate with their customers. Lemonade has shown the insurance industry that this is possible, where the company’s app is the center of its customer service. BlueVine, Fundbox, EZBob, and Kabbage have had similar success with small business lending. EasySend is helping financial institutions create, deploy, and maintain smart forms like loan applications, onboarding, and other tasks.</p>

Digital Identity</a></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Digital identity is something that the entire tech world has been speaking about for some time. The concept of the “digital locker” where someone keeps all their information, be it ID, medical history, banking information, and anything else capable of being digitized, has been something of a holy grail for the financial sector. There is a more pressing issue, especially for financial institutions. In the new era, customers may need to open up accounts without ever entering a branch. Financial institutions will need to authenticate that a user is really who they claim without being able to hold their ID card in their hands.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chatbots and other artificial intelligences are being used to streamline the customer experience and automate processes, freeing up more time and personnel to provide better personalised services where they’re needed. In 2020, there should be plenty of improvements made to conversational banking, as barriers like slang and grammatical errors can still impede their effectiveness. Plus, companies can use data from chatbots gathered in 2019 to achieve more accurate customer intelligence, which should help improve the technology even further.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Data is everywhere, and typically, finance sits on the largest bulk of data. By applying analytics to data, finance can take great strides in improving strategic decisions and enhancing the internal operations. With risk analytics, finance can increase trustworthiness and security of the company. With forensic analytics, finance can bolster tracking of fraud and other forms of financial crime. By unleashing analytics on finance business processes, operational efficiencies can be uncovered. And by adopting analytics on regulatory data-sets, compliance to reporting demands among other requirements can be simplified.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remaining in control of the business is a core part of finance’s remit, and to this end the function has a plethora of internal controls installed across business functions and (cross-functional) processes. From digital transformation and cloud migration to customer service, the finance organisation needs a controls mindset to build out these capabilities effectively. CFOs and finance leaders are well aware of the need to sustain an unwavering focus on strong internal controls. This attention is crucial to apply to data management activities given that the value of the finance organisation's analyses hinges on the quality (and protection) of the data used to produce its forward-looking insights.</p>

<p>While finance organisations always need to monitor and improve their accounting-focused processes and cycles – such as the period-end close, external financial reporting, procure-to-pay and order-to-cash – internal customers are clamouring for more, sharper and more forward-looking financial insights to strengthen their strategic decision-making. This explains why profitability reporting and analysis capabilities are high on the finance agenda, and why more CFOs and finance leaders point to competitive intelligence as a rising priority.</p>

Communication And Consumer Education</a></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As more and more customers get on the digital board, fintech’s will have to focus on building trust and consumer engagement. Especially given the time when cybersecurity is extremely vulnerable. To be critical and to stay ahead of the competition than other fintech brands, it is necessary to focus on the security along with making the procedure simple for consumers. Communication is one of the major keyways to drive engagement with consumers. While the digital payment process might not be new for some segment of consumers, it is entirely a new process for another segment of people.</p>

One Platform, Multiple Services</a></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One thing a consumer prefers the most would be, multiple services across one platform. Many Fintech brands have already rolled out this process of offering multiple services across one app, but the increase in offerings of robust solutions through powerful API integrations will add on. In the coming days, consumers who need banking services are likely to turn to those financial players, who can offer convenience and ease of transactions that is entirely safe and secure. To address these consumer needs, banks cannot do much, but technology can help a lot in digitalizing consumer demand.</p>

Automation, And More Automation</a></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Going by the financial standards and recent global developments, it is safe to assume that the automation cycle will continue and might even accelerate aggressively in the latter part of the year. Although the benefits of automation are great for companies that adopted the measure, some industries are reluctant to embrace it. The reluctance comes from the fear of the unknown in small businesses. The lack of skills to automate practices is another reason why many small business owners are hesitant in automating their practices.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The cluster of innovation among capital raising is Crowd Funding. The major trends among crowd funding includes empowered angel investors and alternative adjudication. Crowd funding platforms are widening access to capital raising activities, making the overall ecosystem richer. Implications for Financial Institutions: Access to more diverse funding options allow new companies to grow at a quicker pace and shorten the average time between early funding stages, Distribution platforms create a venue for investors to tailor their investment portfolio across dimensions beyond financial return, As the barriers to enter the asset class fall, it becomes ever more important for traditional intermediaries’ profitability to find undiscovered “start” investments.</p>
